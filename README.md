# hf_sch_generator
Multivariate hydraulic fracturing simulation tool for optimization calculations.

Purpose: reduce engineer's working time, which spend on routine in this case.
Tasks: make tool, which helps connect the set of hydraulic fracturing schedules, made by engineer in excel, and special modeling software.
Subtasks:
1) Userfriendly interface.
2) Think over a convenient bundle with excel.
3) Input data processing (from excel) and formatting it to the input json (for odeling soft).
4) Output data parsing.
